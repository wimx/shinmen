I’ve been going through a lot in my life. Trying to find a way to get to my goals and gain true and authentic mastery over my life. I’ve always felt that I was above others in this. I always figured that I would be able to enlighten myself. I would run from home because I thought I was better than where I came from, that I had some special insight that would place me where I deserved. I thought I was the one to break the cycles of my bloodline. I was wrong for a long while about that.

It wasn’t until recently that I realized what I needed to conquer first was not outside but in fact back at home, starting with the relationship I have with my father.

There were always unanswered questions about my creation and how he felt about me. So I called him up and told him that we needed to speak. Man to Man. I did and it was wonderful. I told him to level with me. I needed to know that he was a real man and not a concept in held in my mind. I needed to know his fears and insecurities. His dreams. Im 28 years old and I didnt even know my grandfathers name.

Ronnie Albert.

He didnt speak with father either. The cycle strikes again.

He told me everything. There was so much I didnt know and when I did it changed everything. My father, whom i thought believed me a failure, told me to follow my dreams and to not listen to the naysayers or the odds. 

This is what I needed to hear. I recommend talking to your father and forcing him to level with you. Its the only way I think to become a true man. Not in a machismo way but in a maturing adult way. To leave behind the boyishness and allow your father to see you as a grown man and when that happens, you get the permission to see yourself that way as well.
