Humbled by progress and lack there of, I’m creating this blog to document every aspect of my evolution. Projects, ideas, theories…everything. Perhaps it’s time I stop fighting this silent revolution and put what I feel out there for the world to see. I have this feeling that I can make impactful moves so perhaps it’s time for me to make the waves myself. Not only am I going to be cutting open the body of my reclusion, letting you all see the inner workings of my persona, but I’m going to be posting it through a medium that I’m not used to i.e textedit, terminal and github. I don’t even know what that shit means but I’m not going to be posting through some pre curated template like tumblr or wordpress. 

I’ve got feelings. I’ve got plans. I’ve got this urge to shake things up in my life. Stay tuned. I’m gettin’it.
